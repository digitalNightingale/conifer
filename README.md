## Quick start guide

Install Conifer as a WordPress plugin and start using it in your theme.

## Development

To get started hacking on Conifer itself, just do:

```
git clone git@github.com:/sitecrafting/conifer && cd conifer
lando start
```

Follow the prompts and you should have a local WordPress site running Conifer
and its companion starter theme, [Groot](https://github.com/sitecrafting/groot)!
